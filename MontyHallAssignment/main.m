 ****THE MONTY HALL PROBLEM****
 From Wikipedia: Supposed you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No.1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No.3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No.2?". Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?
